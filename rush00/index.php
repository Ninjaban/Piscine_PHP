    All of our slaves are Fair Trade Certified. That means that their are willingly given away by their families or friends, and they are payed accordingly. That way, you do not have to worry about them !
    Plus, you are helping families in need, because we offer them a slave every thousand euros of revenue.

    <h2>Why should you get a slave ?</h2>
    Slaves are handy. They can help you to all sort of tasks, like house chores, teaching your kids, gathering cotton... Some may also entertain the whole family ! People have bought and used slaves for centuries now, why wouldn't you ?
